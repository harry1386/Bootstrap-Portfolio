							<p>Hailing from the central woods of Wisconsin, Harry Arthur Spencer IV is currently working toward completing the KU Coding Bootcamp in hopes of ascertaining a career in the web development world.  Prior to this course, he graduated from Kansas State University in 2009 with a BA in History, he has since completed an Archival Studies Certificate and other graduate work from Emporia State University.  This site, built from the ground up by the aforementioned, not only demonstrates the education and capabilities of this would-be web designer, it also includes a much more in depth portfolio of various projects created.</p>

							

							<p>Yet Harry is not just his education.  Following his graduation from Kansas State University, he decided to take the opportunity of being a graduate with a humanities degree and explore the world.  Doing so, he spent near three years teaching English in South Korea, the majority of his stay working as an Assistant Professor at Dongguk University in Gyeongju-Si.  An excellent opportunity for not only travel and cultural expansion, this period began his professional development.  Upon his return to the States, he has continuously held various teaching positions, from six semesters as a Graduate Teaching Assistant to an Instructor at Flint Hills Technical College.  As with many teaching professional, Harry filled the gaps with positions as a bartender, Festival site crew, as well as work in Archives.  He hopes that this website properly highlights how his varying professional and educational experiences directly affects his strength and skill and a developer.</p>
